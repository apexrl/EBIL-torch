*Pytorch Implemetation of Energy-Based Imitation Learning*

**Important Notes**

This repository is based on [rlswiss](https://github.com/KamyarGh/rl_swiss), which is an extension from the August 2018 version of [rlkit](https://github.com/vitchyr/rlkit). Since then the design approaches of rlswiss and rlkit have deviated quite a bit, and it is for this reason that we are releasing rlswiss as a separate repository. *If you find this repository useful for your research/projects, please cite this repository as well as [rlkit](https://github.com/vitchyr/rlkit).*
